# Step 1: Team Setup and GitHub

- **Project title & short description:**

**HONK!**

A to-do list and scheduling app with a goose-themed design. The app focuses on organization through folder sorting, reminders with pop-up notifications and an integrated calendar.

Users can create detailed schedules for various aspects of their life, such as study plans or plant watering routines. The app allows for custom advanced notifications (e.g., 24 hours and 6 hours before an event, 3 days before an exam, or 15 minutes before medication).

The core visual and audio theme is geese: notifications use goose honking sounds. The application includes a main calendar view for all events and allows for creating separate, themed pages for individual schedules (e.g., a dedicated page for a pet's vet appointments and medication schedule).

Additional features include the ability to add photos to notes, either from the gallery or taken directly within the app.
